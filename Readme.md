## Exercise 1

Write a program that reads 20 integer values ​​in an array from the keyboard and calculates and displays: the sum, the average value, the largest and the smallest.

## Exercise 2

Write a program that reads 20 integer values ​​in an array and displays them on the screen. Then order them from least to greatest and show them again. And finally to order them from largest to smallest and show them a third time. To sort the list, use a function that implements the bubble method and that has the sort type as input parameter, from highest to lowest or lowest to highest. For the array use a global variable.

## Exercise 3

Make a program that contains a function with the prototype bool word(char palindrome[40]);. The function should return true if the word is a palindrome, and false if it is not. A word is a palindrome if when reading from the end to the beginning it is the same as reading from the beginning, for example: "Otto", or with several words "Anita washes the tub", "Give the abbot rice to the fox". In these cases we must ignore the accents and spaces, but it is not necessary for your function to do that, it will suffice to try strings like "anitalavalatina", or "dabalearrozalazorraelabad". The function must not be case sensitive. Hint: Make a for within another: one starts from 0 and goes to array_size, and the other from array_size to 0.

## Exercise 4

Write a string of characters and encrypt it so that each character is actually 3 more letters than the original letter. That is, for the string "abcd", the program displays "defg".

## Exercise 5

Write a program that prints a list of friends saved in an address book. Each friend's data will be stored in a struct, and the address book will be an array of structs.
